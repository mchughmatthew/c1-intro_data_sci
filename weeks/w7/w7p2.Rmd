# Agenda 
* Discuss `gather` and `spread` more


--
### Learning objectives for today
* Get more comfortable with moving from wide to long
* Understand when you may need to "overgather", an how to best approach this


---
# Reasons to prefer tidy data
* More efficient storage and retrieval 
* More scalable 
* The *tidyverse* of tools will work much more efficiently

---
# Read in the hiv data
Note, you'll need to add `header = TRUE` to `import` to get it to treat the
first row as column names instead of data.
* Make some manipulations (just {dplyr} variety) to make the data look like the below.
* Are these data tidy?
* How would you add a new variable - say, percent aids?
* Discuss how you would transform these data, if at all.

```{r gapminder, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))

hiv <- import(here("data", "hiv.csv"),
              setclass = "tbl_df", 
              header = TRUE) 

hiv <- hiv %>% 
    rename(country = `Estimated HIV Prevalence% - (Ages 15-49)`) %>% 
    filter(country == "France" |
           country == "South Africa" |
           country == "United States") %>% 
    select(country, `1979`, `1989`, `1999`, `2009`)
hiv
```

---
# How do we tidy these data?
* Use the `gather()` function from *tidyr*

```{r tidy_gapminder}
hiv_tidy <- hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage, -1)
head(hiv_tidy)
```

# Trying to plot 

```{r plot-fail, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(hiv_tidy, aes(year, percentage, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

---
# Redefine year as numeric

```{r numeric}
library(magrittr)
hiv_tidy %<>%
  mutate(year = parse_number(year))  

head(hiv_tidy)
```

---
# Trying to plot again

```{r plot-success, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(hiv_tidy, aes(year, percentage, color = country)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(size = 2)
```

# Missing data

hiv_tidy %>% 
  filter(!is.na(percentage)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, percentage, color = country)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(size = 2)

### How does `gather` work?


---
# Pop quiz

* What would have happened if I didn't use `-1` to define the columns to gather?

---
# Country is part of the gather

```{r bad_gather}
hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage)
```

---
# Declaring columns to gather
* I could have declared the columns to gather other ways. The important part is just being clear which columns should be part of the gather. All of the below are equivalent

```{r gather1, eval = FALSE}
hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage, -1)
```

```{r gather2, eval = FALSE}
hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage, `1979`, `1989`, `1999`, `2009`)
```

```{r gather3, eval = FALSE}
hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage, `1979`:`2009`)
```

```{r gather4, eval = FALSE}
hiv %>% 
    gather(year, percentage, -country)
```

---
# A few more examples (follow along)
* Load the *votes_repub.csv* dataset.

```{r load_votes_echo, message = FALSE}
votes <- import(here("data", "votes_repub.csv"), 
                setclass = "tbl_df")
head(votes)
```

---
# Discuss with neighbor
* What's the first step to tidy these data?
* Second?

---
# Step 1: Name state

* dplyr syntax

```{r rename_dplyr}
votes <- votes %>% 
  rename(state = V1)
```


---
# Step 2: `gather()`

```{r gather5}
votes %>% 
    gather(year, approval_rating, -1)
```

---
# Clean up some

```{r parse_number1}
votes_tidy <- votes %>% 
    gather(year, approval_rating, -1) %>% 
    mutate(year = parse_number(year))
votes_tidy
```

---
# Exploratory plot
* Can you plot approval ratings by year for the west coast (California, Oregon, and Washington)? 
* What do you observe?

---
# Plot

```{r plot1, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 13}
pd <- votes_tidy %>% 
  filter(state == "California" | 
         state == "Oregon" | 
         state == "Washington")

ggplot(pd, aes(year, approval_rating, color = state)) + 
  geom_line() 
```
