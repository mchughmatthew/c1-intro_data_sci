# What questions do you have?

class: inverse center middle
# Disclaimer
Today we'll be covering the very basics


---
# Creating factors

* Imagine you have a vector of months

```{r months}
months <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
```

--

* We could store this as a string, but there are issues with this. 
	+ There are only 12 possible months 

--
		- factors will help us weed out values that don't conform to our predefined *levels*, which helps safeguard against typos, etc.

--
	+ You can't sort this vector in a meaningful way (it defaults to alphabetic)

--

```{r sort_months}
sort(months)
```

---
# Define it as a factor

```{r month_levels}
month_levels <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
				  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

months <- factor(months, levels = month_levels)
months
```

--

* Now, we can sort	

```{r month_fac_sort}
sort(months)
```

---
# Provides a safety net of sorts

```{r wrong_level, warning = TRUE}
months[5] <- "Jam"
```

--
```{r show-wrong-level}
months
```

---
## What if we don't specify the levels?

* If you define a factor without specifying the levels, it will assign them alphabetically

--

```{r no_level_spec}
mnths <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
factor(mnths)
```

---
# Accessing and modifying levels
* Use the `levels` function

```{r view_levels}
levels(months)
```

--

* Modify levels the base way

```{r modify_levs}
levels(months) <- 1:12
months
```

---
# If you need to, be specific

```{r labels}
months <- factor(months, levels = 1:12, labels = month_levels)
months
```

---
# New package
* When working with factors, we can use the *forcats* package
	+ *for* **cat** egorical variables *s*
	+ anagram for factors
* Part of the tidyverse, so should be good to go

<div align = "right">
<img src = ../img/forcats_hex.png height = 300>
</div>

---
# Change factors 

### Back to the order they appeared

```{r inorder}
c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar") %>% 
	factor()

c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar") %>% 
	factor(levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec"))
```
... see next slide

---

```{r inorder2}
library(forcats)
c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar") %>% 
	factor(levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec")) %>%  
	fct_inorder()
```

---
# Or order by frequency

```{r order_freq}
c("b", "b", "c", "a", "a", "a") %>% 
	fct_infreq()
```

* This can be particularly useful for plotting

---
# Words example

```{r tidytext_words_out_order}
data(sentences, package = "stringr")
sentences <- tibble(sent_num = seq_along(sentences), 
                    sentence = sentences)

sentences
```

---
# Word frequency

```{r word-freq}
library(tidytext)

words_freq <- sentences %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, sentence) %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  filter(n > 30)

head(words_freq)
```

---
# Try to plot frequencies

```{r word_plot_fail, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(words_freq, aes(word, n)) + 
	geom_col()
```

---
# Reorder according to frequency

```{r words_ordered}
words_freq2 <- sentences %>% 
	unnest_tokens(word, sentence) %>% 
	mutate(word = fct_infreq(word)) %>% #<<
	count(word) %>% 
	filter(n > 30)

head(words_freq2)
```

---
# Reproduce plot

```{r word_plot_ordered, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(words_freq2, aes(word, n)) + 
	geom_col()
```

---
# Looking at the levels

```{r levels_check_freq}
levels(factor(words_freq$word))
levels(words_freq2$word) %>%
  head()
```

---
## When do we really want factors?
Generally two reasons to declare a factor
* Only finite number of categories
	+ Treatment/control
	+ Income categories
	+ Performance levels
	+ etc.
* Use in modeling

---
# GSS
General Social Survey

```{r gss_cat1}
gss_cat
```

---
# Investigate factors
Tidyverse gives you convenient  ways to evaluate factors
* Use `count`
* Use `geom_bar` or `geom_col` with *ggplot*

---

```{r count1}
gss_cat %>% 
	count(partyid)
```

---

```{r count2}
gss_cat %>% 
	count(relig)
```

---
```{r plot1}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(partyid)) +
	geom_bar()
```

---
```{r plot2}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(relig)) +
	geom_bar()
```

---
# Missing categories

```{r plot3, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
	geom_bar() 
```

---
# Include missing

```{r plot4, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
	geom_bar() +
	scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)
```

---
# Reorder factors
* Let's bring some (more) automation to the game
* `forcats::fct_reorder`  allows you to easily reorder factors according to
   another variable

```{r relig_summ-echo}
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%
  summarise(tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    		    n = n())

head(relig_summary)
```

---
```{r relig_summ}
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, relig)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
Note - you could actually include the factor reorder right within the `ggplot` call.

```{r relig_summ_reorder, fig.height = 6}
relig_summary <- relig_summary %>% 
	mutate(relig = fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))

ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, relig)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
# Quick aside
### What if we wanted error bars?

```{r errorbars}
relig_summary2 <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%
  summarise(tvhours_mean = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
            tvhours_se   = sqrt(var(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE) / 
                                length(na.omit(tvhours))),
            n = n())

head(relig_summary2)
```

---
```{r errorbar-plot, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(relig_summary2, aes(tvhours_mean, 
                           fct_reorder(relig, tvhours_mean))) + 
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = tvhours_mean - 1.96*tvhours_se,
                     xmax = tvhours_mean + 1.96*tvhours_se),
                 color = "gray70") +
  geom_point() 
```

---
## Revisiting our word frequency example
* An easier way to do what we did before, would be to just include the reorder call right within the call to ggplot

```{r fct_reorder_words, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(words_freq, aes(fct_reorder(word, n), n)) + 
	geom_col()
```

---
# More on modifying factor levels
* `forcats::fct_recode` can make modifying factors more explicit

```{r basic_recode-echo, eval = FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat")) %>%
  count(partyid) 
```

---
```{r basic_recode-eval, echo = FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat")) %>%
  count(partyid) 
```

---
# Collapsing levels
* `fct_recode` can also be used to collapse levels easily

```{r reload_data1, echo = FALSE}
data(gss_cat)
```

```{r fct_recode_collapse_echo, eval = FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party")) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

---
```{r fct_recode_collapse_eval, echo = FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party")) %>%
  count(partyid)
```


---
# Collapse a lot of categories
* One of the more useful functions in *forcats* 
* Collapse all categories into *republican*, *democrat*, *independent*, or *other*.

```{r reload_data2, echo = FALSE}
data(gss_cat)
```

```{r collapse1}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,
    other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

---
# Sometimes even better
* We can "lump" a bunch of categories together using `fct_lump`.
* Default behavior creates an "other" group that includes all but the largest
  group (i.e., lumps the factor into two groups).
* Can also take optional *n* argument, where *n* represents the number of
  groups to collapse to

```{r lump1}
gss_cat %>% 
	mutate(rel = fct_lump(relig)) %>% 
	count(rel)
```

---
# Collapse to 10 religious groups

```{r lump2}
gss_cat %>% 
	mutate(rel = fct_lump(relig, n = 10)) %>% 
	count(rel)
```

# Pattern matching summary
* You can get a lot done with just basic pattern matching and knowing when to escape characters, particularly when you combine the basic pattern matching with other functions.

--
* Regular expressions make your pattern searching abilities much more powerful, and your code much less verbose

--
  + A whole learning curve on its own - for now, it's good to know you'll have
  to escape certain characters.

---
## Symbols you may need to escape

```{r regexpTbl, echo = FALSE}
noquote(c("$","*","+",".","?","[","^","{","|","(","\\"))
